## üß© Extension Core Components

- **`manifest.json`**  
  The mandatory configuration file for every Chrome Extension.  
  It defines metadata such as the extension‚Äôs **name**, **version**, and **description**, as well as its **permissions**, **entry points**, and **scripts**.

- **Content Script (`content.js`)**  
  A JavaScript file that runs in the context of a web page.  
  It can interact with the page‚Äôs DOM and is useful when you want to **analyze, rewrite, or summarize** webpage text using APIs like the **Rewriter API** or **Summarizer API**.

- **Background Script (`background.js`)**  
  Runs in the background (as a service worker in Manifest V3).  
  It handles long-running tasks, message passing, and context menu actions ‚Äî such as **triggering AI actions**, **listening for user events**, or **managing extension state**.

- **Popup HTML (`popup.html`)**  
  The small window that appears when you click the extension‚Äôs icon in Chrome.  
  It provides the **user interface** ‚Äî like buttons, input boxes, or output areas ‚Äî to interact with AI models.  
  No backend or external API calls are required if you‚Äôre using **Chrome‚Äôs built-in Gemini Nano APIs**.
